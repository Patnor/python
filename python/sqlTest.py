-- Subquery (Inner Query):
-- The inner query selects information about customers (first_name, last_name) and their associated sales (sale_id) from the sale and customer tables.
-- It uses a NATURAL JOIN to join the sale and customer tables based on their common columns, which are likely related to the customer's purchase history.
-- The WHERE clause filters the results to include only customers with a customer number (customer_numb) of 6 or 10.

-- Main Query:
-- The main query selects columns from the volume table (v) and the results of the subquery (t).
-- It joins the volume table with the results of the subquery using a JOIN clause with the USING keyword, specifying the common column sale_id.
-- This join ensures that only volumes associated with sales made by customers with customer numbers 6 or 10 are included in the final result.

 -- Let's break down the statement step by step:

-- Subquery (Inner Query):
-- The innermost subquery selects the sale_id from the volume table where the ISBN is '987-1-11111-122-1'.
-- This subquery is used to identify sales associated with the volume with ISBN '987-1-11111-122-1'.

-- The middle subquery selects the sale_id from the volume table where the ISBN is '987-1-11111-146-1'.
-- It also filters the results to include only the sales that are present in the results of the innermost subquery.
-- This subquery is used to identify sales associated with the volume with ISBN '987-1-11111-146-1', which are also associated with the volume with ISBN '987-1-11111-122-1'.

-- Outer Subquery:
-- The outer subquery selects the customer_numb from the sale table where the sale ID is present in the results of the middle subquery.
-- It identifies customers who have made purchases of both volumes ('987-1-11111-146-1' and '987-1-11111-122-1').

-- Main Query:
-- The main query selects the last_name and first_name columns from the customer table.
-- It filters the results to include only customers whose customer_numb is present in the results of the outer subquery.

-- JOINs:
-- The query uses implicit JOINs (comma-separated table names in the FROM clause) to join the tables together. This type of join is known as a cross join or Cartesian product, where every row from each table is combined with every row from every other table.
-- However, the conditions in the WHERE clause effectively filter out unwanted combinations, making the cross join act like an inner join.

-- Filtering Conditions:
-- The WHERE clause contains filtering conditions to restrict the result set.
-- s.customer_numb = 11: Filters the sales records to include only those belonging to customer number 11.
-- w.author_numb = a.author_numb: Matches the author number in the work table (w) with the author number in the author table (a).
-- w.work_numb = b.work_numb: Matches the work number in the work table (w) with the work number in the book table (b).
-- b.isbn = v.isbn: Matches the ISBN in the book table (b) with the ISBN in the volume table (v).
-- v.sale_id = s.sale_id: Matches the sale ID in the volume table (v) with the sale ID in the sale table (s).

-- Here's why you don't need to specify a column to join explicitly:

-- Common Columns: NATURAL JOIN automatically matches columns in the joined tables that have the same name. 
-- In this case, the tables likely have columns with the same name that represent the relationship between them. 
-- For example, the book and work tables might both have a column named work_numb that represents the relationship 
-- between a book and its corresponding work.

-- Simplicity and Convenience: Using NATURAL JOIN simplifies the SQL statement by avoiding the need to specify the 
-- join conditions explicitly. This can make the SQL code cleaner and easier to read, especially for simple 
-- queries where the join conditions are straightforward.

-- Reduced Risk of Errors: By letting the database engine handle the join conditions automatically, 
-- there is less risk of errors in specifying the join conditions incorrectly. This can help avoid mistakes 
-- such as misspelling column names or forgetting to include necessary join conditions.

-- However, it's important to note that while NATURAL JOIN can be convenient for simple queries, 
-- it may not always be suitable for more complex join scenarios or when working with tables that 
-- have columns with the same name but different meanings. In such cases, it's recommended to use explicit JOIN syntax 
-- and specify the join conditions explicitly to ensure clarity and accuracy in the query.

-- 	SQL coding style
-- SQL keywords are case-insensitive for most RDBMS, including MySQL. But all SQL keywords should be written in UPPER CASE.
-- For MySQL, column, index, stored routine, and event names are not case-sensitive on any platform, nor are column aliases.
-- snake_case is a widely used convention for column name and database name.
-- In contrast, LetterCase is widely used for table name.
-- Do not mix the usage of single and double quote.
-- Indent when you write sub-query.
